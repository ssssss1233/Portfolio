            <h3>Letter to my year 12 SELF!</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="le">Dear year 12 me, Call me Subu. It's been a while but how are you? How are you doing, you good? What I'm saying is I don't care what your job is, how you fight, just how you have been? Your or My current family is good. I’m excited for what we’re going to do this year. Everything was nice but things got dark. Hope you're good.


                My boyny is spoiled, my mummy is unusual and buba was kind.How do things work for you? How do you do stuff? Do you have a love interest or are you happy going to uni or being a chef? My sanity is boiling with questions I wish you could answer. How is Sirisha? I hope she's ok, the things she did are concerning but really how is everything ok or not?I want to remember the good times, the good days of fun and prosperity in life. The best time was fighting boyny, it was funny.
               
               
               The things I have done are concerning but interesting I have regrets so are they clear? However I feel like people are different, I mean they are but I mean It feels unattached and dispersed differently. Broken things aren't broken just different but fixed things are different. Food tech is the best. Maybe I will be a chef who knows! But that's all i’ll say it's been fun and I hope for the best. Have a great time!
